tariffic
========

An experimental chrome extension to overlay Trade Tariff information on Sainsbury's online in the form of food-health style labelling. The output of a late night and early morning at the DFID Data Challenge.

Data comes, in a couple of different ways, from http://worldbank.org.

I chose Sainsbury's because they seem more willing (than Tescos at least) to display country of origin - for which I commend them. It still works best for goods like posh coffee where there's a marketing advantage for proclaiming the origin country.

Next steps? Implement an alternative display for products with no listed country of origin - perhaps something which says.

"Warning! No stated Country of Origin. Don't put it in your mouth if you don't know where its been."
